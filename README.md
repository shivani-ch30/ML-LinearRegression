# Linear Regression Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression using Python. 
It includes data preprocessing, handling missing values, outlier detection, label encoding, and model training.

## Features Implemented:
- Handling **null values**:
  - Numerical columns: Replaced with **mean** or **median**.
  - Categorical columns: Replaced with **mode**.
- **Outlier Detection** using visualization techniques.
- **Label Encoding** to convert categorical data into numerical form.
- Linear Regression model training and evaluation.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for model training)

## Dataset:
The project uses 'insurance_data.csv` for training the model.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the 'LinearREg1.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Upload the 'insurance_data.csv' file
5. Execute the cells step-by-step to preprocess data and train the model.

## Result:
1. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.
3. Data visualizations help in understanding feature importance and data distribution.

## Why this proj?
1. Fundamental Machine Learning Concept – Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used ML algorithms, making it a great starting point for understanding predictive modeling.
2. Real-World Applications – It is used in finance, healthcare, sales forecasting, and risk analysis, making it highly practical.
3. Data Preprocessing Experience – This project covers handling missing values, detecting outliers, and encoding categorical data, which are essential skills in data science.
4. Model Evaluation – Learning to evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score helps in understanding how well predictions match real data.
5. Visualization & Interpretation – Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize data distributions, trends, and relationships improves exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills.
